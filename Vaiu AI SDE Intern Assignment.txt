Vaiu AI Software Developer Internship Assignment
Assignment Overview
Duration: 1-2 days ​
Submission: GitHub repository link​
Objective: Build a functional voice-enabled AI agent with custom integrations
This assignment will help us evaluate your:
●​
●​
●​
●​

Full-stack development skills (MERN stack)
Ability to integrate third-party APIs
Problem-solving and code quality
Understanding of voice/conversational AI concepts

Use Case: Restaurant Booking Voice Agent
Build an intelligent voice agent that helps users book restaurant tables through natural
conversation. The agent should be able to:
1.​ Greet the user and understand their booking intent
2.​ Collect booking information through voice:
○​ Number of guests
○​ Preferred date and time
○​ Cuisine preference (Italian, Chinese, Indian, etc.)
○​ Special requests (birthday, anniversary, dietary restrictions)
3.​ Fetch real-time weather for the booking date and suggest indoor/outdoor seating
4.​ Confirm booking details via voice
5.​ Store booking in a database

Technical Requirements
Option 1: Use LiveKit
LiveKit Agents Framework - Perfect for voice agents!
Resources:
●​ GitHub: https://github.com/livekit-examples
●​ Docs: https://docs.livekit.io/agents/
●​ Quick Start: https://docs.livekit.io/agents/quickstart/
Option 2: Alternative Frameworks (If you prefer)
●​ Vocode: https://github.com/vocodedev/vocode-python
●​ Pipecat: https://github.com/pipecat-ai/pipecat
●​ Web Speech API: Browser-based (simpler but less powerful)

Must Have (Core Requirements):
1. Voice Interaction
●​ Implement speech-to-text (user input)
●​ Implement text-to-speech (agent responses)
●​ Handle voice commands naturally
Suggested Libraries:
●​
●​
●​
●​

Web Speech API (browser-based, free)
Google Cloud Speech-to-Text / Text-to-Speech
OpenAI Whisper API (speech-to-text)
ElevenLabs (text-to-speech)

2. Backend API (Node.js + Express)
Create RESTful endpoints:
POST /api/bookings

- Create a new booking

GET /api/bookings

- Get all bookings

GET /api/bookings/:id

- Get specific booking

DELETE /api/bookings/:id

- Cancel booking

3. Database (MongoDB)
Design a schema for restaurant bookings:
{
bookingId: String,
customerName: String,
numberOfGuests: Number,
bookingDate: Date,
bookingTime: String,
cuisinePreference: String,
specialRequests: String,

weatherInfo: Object,
seatingPreference: String, // indoor/outdoor
status: String, // confirmed, pending, cancelled
createdAt: Date
}

4. Custom Integration: Weather API
Required Feature:
●​ Integrate a weather API (OpenWeatherMap, WeatherAPI.com, etc.)
●​ When user provides booking date, fetch weather forecast
●​ Agent should verbally suggest seating:
○​ "The weather looks great on [date]! Would you prefer outdoor seating?"
○​ "It might rain on [date]. I'd recommend our cozy indoor area."
Implementation:
// Example weather integration
async function getWeatherForDate(date, location) {
// Fetch weather forecast
const weather = await weatherAPI.getForecast(date, location);

// Generate voice response based on weather
if (weather.condition === 'sunny') {
return "Perfect weather for outdoor dining!";
} else if (weather.condition === 'rainy') {
return "Looks like rain. Indoor seating would be better.";
}
}

What NOT to Do:
Do NOT use random LLM responses for weather information.
Agent MUST fetch real data from YOUR backend API and use that data in
responses.

Bonus Features (Optional)
Implement any of these to stand out:
1.​ Natural Language Processing
○​ Use OpenAI GPT API for intelligent conversation
○​ Handle variations in user input ("I want to book a table" vs "Table for 2")
2.​ Multi-language Support
○​ Support Hindi + English voice commands
○​ Code-switching capability
○​

3.​ Calendar Integration
○​ Show available time slots
○​ Prevent double bookings
4.​ SMS/Email Confirmation
○​ Send booking confirmation via Twilio SMS
○​ Email receipt using NodeMailer
5.​ Admin Dashboard
○​ View all bookings
○​ Analytics (peak hours, popular cuisines)
○​ Export reports

Deliverables:
1.​ Working voice agent (can run locally)
2.​ Clean code with comments
3.​ README with setup instructions
4.​ Screen recording (2-3 min) showing it working

Deliverables Checklist
